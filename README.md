# Livecoding session tech interview

Two small functions in `src/livecode.js`, that are blank if you want to have a go. 
My solution in `src/master.js`

Takeaways:
1. having tests at the beginning is really nice
2. make sure to do the design part correct - pseudocode
3. talk about your thought process a lot
4. ask question regarding syntax if needed

## Node version
` v16.14.2`

## To test
```shell 
npm test

# OR 

node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js
```
